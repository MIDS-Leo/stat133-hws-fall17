Quadratic Equation
------------------

Here is the *general* form of the quadratic equation: ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0 The quadratic formula is this: $-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} \\over 2a$

|         Name| Equation                    |
|------------:|:----------------------------|
|    Quadratic| ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0 |
|       Linear| ax+b                        |
|  Exponential| ab<sup>x</sup>              |

**Description:** This equation is common and learnt in algebra. Various parabolic graphs and roots can be solved with this popular equation. "x" is the root and *a*, *b*, and *c* are coefficients. This equation is second degree. Other ways of finding roots can be completing the square or factoring.

Comments and Reflections
------------------------

-   Some areas that were hard was determining the appropriate syntax for math notation and referring specifics that may not have been in cheatsheets.
-   The tutorials were helpful in applying what I read right away.
-   Inputting and structuring the file was more straightforward.
-   This is the first time I am using markdown, and I utilized the online cheatsheet and resources. The more time consuming part was researching and self-learning.
