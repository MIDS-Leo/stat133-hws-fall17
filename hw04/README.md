# HW 04 Grades Visualizer
##### This assignment encompasses the whole process of obtaining raw data, cleaning and sorting out the data, analyzing the data, and then summarizing the data in an app. In particular, the dataset used was fictional STAT 133 class data.

## Comments/Reflections

- This was my first time writing unit tests.
- The logic of testthat tests were overall straightforward, on a scale of 4.
- This was my first time working with ggvis
- ggvis was confusing on a scale of 4
- I worked with tabset panel instead of conditional panel, and it was on a scale 9.
- I like ggplot most since the operator syntax makes it seem more straightforward.
- My GSI helped me with the some parts of the syntax of the Shiny app
- It took about 13 hours to complete this homework.
- The most time consuming part was cleaning the data.
